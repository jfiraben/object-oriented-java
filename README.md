# Object-Oriented Techniques for IT Problem Solving

## Description:
> "Introduces techniques for developing solutions to business problems using object-oriented programming as an IT resource/tool. Students apply problem solving concepts by analyzing problems and constructing, testing, and implementing object‐oriented solutions using object-oriented analysis and design, data modeling, and object-oriented programming fundamentals. Topics include: Unified Modeling Language (UML), classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling."

## Topics: 
> "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
> * Describe the relationship between an object and its corresponding class.
> * Describe how constructors and destructors relate to the life of an object.
> * Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.
> * Discuss and identify the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.
> * Describe the relationship between the static structure of the class and the dynamic structure of the instances of the class.
> * Design, implement, test, and debug programs in an object-oriented programming language.
> * Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding.
> * Define the concept of inheritance and describe how it can be applied to encourage code reuse.
> * Design an abstract class and use inheritance to create a class that extends the abstract class.
> * Compare and contrast the differences between structured and object-oriented programming paradigms.
> * Design, implement, and test the implementation of “is-a” relationships among object using a class hierarchy and inheritance.
> * Design, develop, and test an application that uses an abstract class.
> * Design solutions to problems using object-oriented techniques.
> * Create and use simple and complex static data structures in an object-oriented environment.
> * Compare and contrast the notions of overloading and overriding methods in an object-oriented language.
> * Develop code that responds to exception conditions raised during execution.
> * Manage complexity in an information technology environment by applying best practices and using appropriate technologies and methodologies (Unified Modeling Language).
> * Apply effective debugging strategies."
