The following program is used to to create a keep track of warehouses that supply the GMU food
Industries restaurants. The program allows the user to do several tasks including: Add a warehouse,
Delete a warehouse, Display all warehouses, Mark a warehouse as preferred or not preferred, and 
exit the program at any time and display the warehouses in the system.

If the user has not entered anything in the system and tries to delete a warehouse, mark a warehouse
as preferred or not preferred, or display the warehouses, they will receive an error that says there
are currently no warehouses in the system. The program will display errors when an incorrect item is
entered anywhere. Once the user is done with the program, they can choose to exit the system and
either receive a notice saying there are currently no warehouses in the system, or they will receive
a printout with all of the warehouses in the system.
