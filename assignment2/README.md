The following program is used to to create a keep track of restaurant information(for now just one restaurant)
for student run restaurants in the Norther Virginia area. The program will take a name for the restaurant. The
name must be entered or else the program will not continue to the other information. The program will then allow
the user to enter the number of employees and the number of seats at the restaurant. If the user chooses to use
the default value of 1 employee and/or 14 seats, they can enter 0 in the respective dialog boxes.The program will
then ask if the user has insurance or not. They can choose to enter either "yes" or "no".  Once the user
has entered the name, number of employees, seats, and insurance, they will be asked to enter the amount of sales. 
User can enter any number between $0.50 and $150. The user will be asked if they'd like to continue entering amount
of sales after each sale is entered. Once the user is finished entering the amount of sales, they will be presented
with a well-formatted report containing the name of the restaurant, number of employees, number of seats, total
amount of sales, and the total number of sales.

The required input is the name of the restaurant, number of employees(default 1), number of seats (default 14),
and amount of sales(can enter as many sales as wanted). The expected output is name of the restaurant, number
of employees, number of seats, number of sales, total amount of sales, and if the restaurant has insurance.
